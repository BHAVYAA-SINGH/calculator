*   **`style.css`:**  Styles the appearance of the calculator, including the layout, colors, fonts, and button styles.  Uses CSS selectors to target specific elements and classes.

*   **`script.js`:**  Contains the JavaScript logic that handles user interactions, performs calculations, and updates the display.  It uses event listeners to respond to button clicks and functions to perform arithmetic operations.
